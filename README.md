# Task

Page 1:- We can able to see user posts with name and title of the post. Both the details are not there in single api. So filtering name as per User id and printing name and title of the post.

Page 2:- Once the User click the post i am passing id and getting comments. Body and title i am passing from firest screen as a params.

Page 2:- With Delete icon i am deleting the post and redirecting to previous page.

React Hooks are use for both the pages and navigation 5 have been implemented for basic navigation.


Thanks.
